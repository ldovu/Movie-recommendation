INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE DESIGN (224MI) - Final project

Data Engineer and Software Engineer: Simone Cossaro

Software Developer: Ludovica Caiola

The aim of this project is to design a web application based on a machine learning system for movie recommendation.

Four inputs are required from the user:
- children or adult?
- emotion to feel (belonging to a list)
- film target(optional)
- maximum time

Based on these inputs, the application quickly returns 10 recommended movie titles with their respective plots.

If the film target is not entered, the system returns the 10 most popular movies based on the mood.
